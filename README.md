Mathematica and R codes for the manuscript on abrupt and quasi-synchrony decline of trees during the Holocene.

- The Mathematica code 'clean_complile_data.nb' cleans and compiles the multi-taxa data, including splitting and merging the Pinus subgenera, creating a database for site ID, site coordinates, name, time series summary (length, mean resolution etc), species occurrences, abrupt changes occurrences etc and a second databases for the timing of abrupt increases and decreases for each site for each species.

- The Mathematica code 'code_paleo_lottery.nb' generates all the simulated data and plots all figures in the manuscript and the supplements.

- The R code contains extracts records from Neotoma for hemlock and computes the Bayesian Change Point (BCP) analyses for both empirical and simulated data.
